In a real market data system we usually tend to have a process that is in charge of subscribing to an external feed. It gets a tick
from the external systems and publishes the data to any one listening to the tick events.
I created a Feed Interface which provide the contract on how to subscribe/unsubscribe and receive tick events.
Because this comes from an external feed it is advisable to have the handling of the tick on a different thread. This thread would simply
get a tick and add that to the eventQueue of the listeners.

The FeedListener runs on a separate thread and is going to consume the trades it receives on its queue. It knows what Handler to call to process the trade
The TradeHandler interface provide contracts for handling trades and printing result to stdout
SubscriptionConfig provides details about the rics and the Handlers for handling the trades for that ric

for example in subscriptionConfig file you can define entry like below:
XYZ LN,LargestTradeHandler:AveragePriceHandler
